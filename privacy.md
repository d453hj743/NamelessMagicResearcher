Privacy Policy for 1H NMR Report Generator

  Last Updated: February 6, 2026

  This Privacy Policy describes how the "1H NMR Report Generator" (the "Application") handles your information.


  1. No Personal Data Collection
  We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data, identifying information, or sensitive user information. The Application is designed to function entirely within your web browser (as a    
  PWA) or as a local installation.


  2. Image Processing and OCR
  The Application includes Optical Character Recognition (OCR) functionality to help you input NMR peak data.
   * Local Processing: All image processing and text recognition are performed locally on your device using Tesseract.js.
   * No Uploads: Your images are NEVER uploaded to any server or shared with any third party. Once you close the application or clear the cache, the processed image data is discarded.


  3. Local Storage
  The Application uses your browser’s localStorage to save your "Signal Table" data so that your progress is not lost when you refresh the page. This data remains on your physical device and is not
  accessible by the developer or any third party. You can clear this data at any time by using the "Clear All Data" button within the app or by clearing your browser's site data.


  4. External Libraries
  The Application loads the Tesseract.js library via official CDNs (Content Delivery Networks). These CDNs may log standard technical information (such as IP addresses and browser types) for       
  security and traffic analysis purposes, consistent with standard web practices.

  5. Changes to This Policy
  We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page.
